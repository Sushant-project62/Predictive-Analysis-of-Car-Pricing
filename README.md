# Predictive-Analysis-of-Car-Pricing
Developed a machine learning model for predicting used car prices using regression analysis and data visualization.
Predictive Analysis of Car Pricing
üìå Project Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze historical car price data to build a regression model that provides accurate price estimates.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Techniques: Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
